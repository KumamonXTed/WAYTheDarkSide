WAYTheDarkSide
==============

The WAYTheDarkSide class provides several **helper methods** to handle OS X Yosemite's new Dark Mode. Use this class to determine if the system appearance is currently set up to be in the Dark Mode or not, and if it supports it anyways.

Next, specify **event handlers** per view or window controller (or any other object), which will be performed whenever the user switches the Dark Mode system preference.

Yes, the names are a little ironic.

**The long story**

In 2014, OS X 10.10 Yosemite introduced a new system-wide Dark Mode, which makes the main menu and the Dock look dark and mean. In some situations, it may be appropriate to adapt the dark look in your application.
However there do not seem to be some obvious APIs you can use to determine the current user setting or to handle setting change events. We provide the WAYTheDarkSide class to simplify the adaption of the new look.

Example
-------

```objc
// The application decided to join the dark side
[WAYTheDarkSide welcomeApplicationWithBlock:^{
	[weakSelf.window setAppearance:[NSAppearance appearanceNamed:NSAppearanceNameVibrantDark]];
	[weakSelf.contentView setMaterial:NSVisualEffectMaterialDark];
	[self.label setStringValue:@"Dark!"];
} immediately:YES];

// The application decided to leave the dark side
[WAYTheDarkSide outcastApplicationWithBlock:^{
	[weakSelf.window setAppearance:[NSAppearance appearanceNamed:NSAppearanceNameVibrantLight]];
	[weakSelf.contentView setMaterial:NSVisualEffectMaterialLight];
	[self.label setStringValue:@"Light!"];
} immediately:YES];
```

or locally in your ```NSWindowController``` / ```NSViewController``` instances:

```objc
[WAYTheDarkSide welcomeObject:self withBlock:^{
	 /* ... */ 
} immediately:YES];

[WAYTheDarkSide outcastObject:self withBlock:^{ /* ... */ } immediately:YES];
```

Usage
-----

It's quite simple, you should check the headers. The class provides no singleton, but makes use of simple class methods instead.

1. ```#import "WAYTheDarkSide.h"```
2. Specify a global event handler block using ```welcomeApplicationWithBlock:immediately:;``` and ```outcastApplicationWithBlock:immediately:;```.

or

2. Specify a per-object event handler block using ```welcomeObject:withBlock:immediately:;``` and ```outcastObject:withBlock:immediately:;```.
